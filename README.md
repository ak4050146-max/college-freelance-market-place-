 About the Project

This is my first multi-page web project, created as part of my learning journey in web development.
The goal of this project is to design a simple, clean, and user-friendly platform for students to  explore income opportunities.

While building this project, I focused on understanding:

How multi-page websites work

Clean and responsive layouts

Reusable CSS styling

Basic project structure followed in real-world applications

I am still learning JavaScript fundamentals and intermediate-level CSS, and this project will continue to evolve as my skills grow.

 Tech Stack Used

HTML – Page structure

CSS – Styling and responsiveness
